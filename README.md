# 🔥 Fire Detection with YOLOv8 & SMS Alerts  

This project implements an **intelligent fire and smoke detection system** using a custom-trained **YOLOv8 deep learning model**. 
The system processes video input and identifies fire 🔥 and smoke 💨 in real time, drawing bounding boxes around detected regions.
Once fire is detected, it triggers an **automated SMS alert** through the **Vonage API**, notifying users to take immediate action.  

In addition to live detection, the program saves a processed version of the video with detection annotations for later review. 
It is designed to work seamlessly in **Google Colab** as well as on local machines, making it adaptable for research, safety monitoring,
or real-world deployment in environments like buildings, factories, or surveillance systems.
